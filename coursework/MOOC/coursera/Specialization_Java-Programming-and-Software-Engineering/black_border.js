/* A solution to part 3 of "Programming Exercise: Advanced Modifying Images" from Week 2
 * By Aleksey
 * 
 * The problem: "Write a function named setBlack that has one parameter pixel (representing a 
 * single pixel) and returns pixel with its red, green, and blue components changed so that 
 * the pixelâ€™s color is black. Now you will write another function named addBorder. This function 
 * will add a black border to an image, [...] Work through the seven steps to write this function. 
 * Work an example by hand and note the steps you took before translating your algorithm to code. 
 * Which pixels should be part of the border? How will you identify those pixels? Once you have 
 * identified them, how will you make them black?"
